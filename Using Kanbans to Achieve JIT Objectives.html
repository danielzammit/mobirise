        <h2 class="mbr-section-title pb-3 align-center mbr-fonts-style display-2">1. Kanbans Definition and their Use.</h2>
        <h3 class="mbr-section-subtitle pb-5 align-center mbr-fonts-style display-5">Kanbans are a tool used to implement JIT and are a famous pull system. A Kanban is one of many tools which may be utilised to maintain a Just-in-Time production system and often go hand-in-hand. In a JIT process, a healthy flow of products is essential. The Kanban originated from a statistical inventory management system called the ‘reordering point method’, however the name ‘Kanban’ was first coined by Toyota motors [1].</h3>

                                <p class="mbr-content-text mbr-fonts-style display-7">Kanban roughly translates to ‘sign board’ in Japanese and is a widely adopted method of communication between downstream processes with upstream processes. This system of production is based on the use of cards to authorise production and work flow in the plant and allows for manufacturers to be able to reorder the same volume of parts with each cycle. One big advantage of applying Kanbans to a manufacturing process is that it allows you to visually manage the process, thus allowing for real time adjustments to product flow upon fluctuations of demand. This is due to the constant communication between downstream and upstream processes. Commonly a Kanban is a card that simply contains product information. Such a card identifies part number, part description, company name and card number. Often Kanbans are barcoded as well. Some companies instead of using cards make use of verbal kanban, containers and wireless kanbans [1],[2].<br></p>

                                <p class="mbr-content-text mbr-fonts-style display-7">For the successful implementation of a Kanban based system, it must first be made sure that the manufacturing system in place is one of a pull-type system. When the use of Kanbans first became popular in Japan, companies flocked to make use of this system only to find out that this system was not effective for their system type. The Kanban system is especially useful in systems where fluctuations in demand are small and uncommon. This system keeps inventory management down and lightens the clerical workload [1].<br></p>

It also organises the flow of parts leading to a more streamlined and organised work flow.&nbsp;<span style="font-size: 1rem;">However, Kanbans tend to set limits on the product flow rate. Since there are a fixed number of Kanbans, the flow of products is predefined by the amount of Kanbans allotted to the process.

This is due to the fact that a Kanban system generally tends to garner in-process inventory and excessive handling. Despite this, the Kanban system is far better attuned to modern demands than its more traditional counterpart, the push system.

                            Dell is also a company which implements JIT principles. Dell have a different JIT approach compared to Toyota, whereby they reduce inventory storage by forcing their suppliers to carry the inventory instead of carrying it themselves. Components are then assembled by Dell quickly and shipped to the customer. This approach by Dell proved successful since suppliers are dependable and satisfy Dell’s demanding lead time requirements [4], [5].</p>

Monthly, quarterly and yearly targets were set for the material flow and output. The company, being one heavily invested in the automotive market, apply the philosophy of lean manufacturing to each of their processes to maintain their competitive prices and profit margins. The company boasts that their prices, when coampared to the Chinese markets, are on average 25% cheaper. This may be attributed to their operational organisation and their ability to maintain a lean manufacturing environment.

The company employs thousands of people and has expanded its capabilities to produce a wider variety of parts and has become involved in more phases of development of its products.</p><p>Waterville’s production process is based on four stages. The first process is where synthetic rubber is mixed with other materials to form a rubber compound in ribbon form. In the second stage, rubber is then fed into extrusion lines where it is shaped and cured according to the desired dimensions. In the third stage extrusion parts are molded. Finally, in the fourth stage all secondary operations such as trimming and coating are performed by subcontractors. Figure 8 shows the process that has just been described. This company makes use of kanbans and has been doing so since the 90's [6].</p></div>

In this image one can see the barcode allocated to the kanban, description, part number, point of storage and receiving area. The alternate unit of measurement is used when the minimum quantity shipped by the supplier results in several days of supply. Hence, instead of assigning one kanban per pallet, the company subdivides the pallet into smaller quantities to ensure a more continuous flow and avoid reordering a whole pallet. The barcode is imperative since it enables the recording of transactions and the identification of Kanban’s by their number (3 in this case). Kanbans can switch from inactive to active when materials are received and vice versa when material is consumed. Hence, with the number of active cards the company knows its precise inventory level. This leads to better first-in, first-out control [6].</p></div>

In fact, two cards are used; the P card and the E card as in the figure below. The P card is the production kanban while the E card is the shipping kanban. P card is removed for scanning to report production transactions. While the E-card shipping kanban conveys the production signal prior shipping. These cards are placed in the same self-adhesive pouch to be attached to the shipping container. When the finished products arrive at the shipping area the production card is then removed and scanned. [6]</p></div>
