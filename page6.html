        <h3 class="mbr-section-subtitle pb-5 align-center mbr-fonts-style display-5">The main goal of every manufacturing company is to optimise its processes to create high quality products within a reasonable time frame, whilst preserving profits wherever possible. A common method of process optimisation is through the implementation of Kanbans, which falls under the umbrella of JIT manufacturing.</h3>

                                <p class="mbr-content-text mbr-fonts-style display-7">The use of such systems is highly regarded in its effectiveness in reducing inventory. Inventory in itself is an inherent burden to the manufacturing company as it incurs additional costs in the form of interest payments, maintenance, boarded surpluses and price-cutting. Aside from creating additional costs, excess inventory takes up storage space, consumes extra energy, and requires further management to be correctly organised. The incidence of excess inventory generally stems from unbalanced capacity and inventory flow, monthly rushes, ‘just-in-case’ inventory and outdated inventory flow methods. In summary, though the implementation a JIT manufacturing method, a company may optimise its pull-processes and create more efficient material flow through the use of Kanbans [1],[2].<br></p>

                                <p class="mbr-content-text mbr-fonts-style display-7">Software tools can be used to speed up the paper-lead time. However, this might not be the case in the physical-lead time phase of the manufacturing process. Instead, changes are often necessary on the factory floor so that it suits the modern requirements and is aligned to the JIT philosophy . These changes are known as ‘JIT Improvements’.<br>The JIT production is a manufacturing approach in which the customer’s requirements are put before and above everything else.<br>JIT refers to the timing of production flow; goods are delivered to the manufacturing lines just in time to be used, just in the immediately needed quantities, and just to the production processes that need them. Saying “in time” is not enough, since parts can arrive at processes a week or two prior to their use and still be there “in time.”<br>JIT is defined as a processing method in which products are supplied at a regularised pace relative to other push processes, where the receiving stations can make use of such supplies as soon as they are required. In other words, the mother company must make sure that their customers and stations receive their products ‘just-in-time’.</p>

                                <p class="mbr-content-text mbr-fonts-style display-7">In this way, the amount of excess accumulated inventory is reduced massively, since the company now has the ability to adapt its production with respect to the consumption of downstream processes. In JIT the ‘in-time’ does not directly imply that products arrive just before they are required, however they arrive within a time period which is suitable for comfortable consumption. The following is a list of improvements often carried out in manufacturing system in order to fit the JIT philosophy:</p>

Waste is defined as any activity that does not add value from the customer’s perspective. In essence, the main point of working with lean manufacturing is to reduce the amount of wasteful processes created within a factory. In other words, lean manufacturing is a method of producing high quality goods with the least possible residue [3].</div><br><div><strong>Seven Deadly Wastes of Lean Manufacturing</strong></div><div><strong><br></strong></div><div><strong>1. Overproduction</strong>​: manufacturing an amount of product more than which is necessary. This comes with the risk of the extra products remaining unsold.</div><div><em>Countermeasures: Pace production, pull system, reduction in setup times.</em></div><div><br></div><div><strong>2. Waiting​:</strong> time-wasting is a serious waste which can prove to be economically costly to any business.</div><div><em>Countermeasures: continuous flow, standardized work, effective communication.</em></div><div><br></div><div><strong>3. Transport​:</strong> Unnecessary movement of materials from one location to another. <em>Countermeasures: Value stream mapping, continuous flow, theory of constraints.</em></div><div><br></div><div><strong>4.

Overprocessing​: </strong>processes which the product can do without, costing time and</div><div>money.</div><div><em>Countermeasures: compare customer requirements to manufacturing specifications, highlighting potential simplifications to the manufacturing process</em></div><div><br></div><div><strong>6. Inventory​:</strong> importing of goods that include accessories which are not required. They are therefore considered a surplus to requirement.</div><div><em>Countermeasure: raw materials are brought in as necessity. This reduces the number of steps during manufacturing.</em></div><div><br></div><div><strong>7. Defects​: </strong>after quality checks, extra work is done on the workpiece</div><div><em>Countermeasures: better manufacturing processes and design processes so as to inform the user about any issues which the goods may suffer from and settle them. Common mistakes and noted so that these can be in avoided in future operations [3].</em></div></div>

                     <p class="p-3"><span style="font-size: 1rem;">Just-in-time manufacturing is a type a process in which inventories are minimized in such a way that the exact number of units are produced in order for the next process to initiate. This process was first developed by Taiichie Ohno for Toyota Motors in Japan. Their objective was to eliminate any works in process or inventories as much as possible. In a JIT philosophy, any build-up of products at a station are seen as a burden to the company as they take up space, money, investment funds, and workers [1],[2].&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 1rem;">The process was always client oriented such that any fluctuations in demand will be levelled by adjustments in the production flow.</span></p><p class="p-3"><br></p>

                     <p class="p-3">Just-in-time refers to the way that products are delivered to the manufacturing lines. In this case they must always arrive just as they are about to be used or are required. A JIT system must also produce exactly the right number of components that are needed to fulfil the next stage/operation, and is supplied right when it is needed, thus the components are ‘just in time’ [1],[2].&nbsp;<span style="font-size: 1rem;">JIT processes are the most effective in high volume and repetitive manufacturing systems, such as in the automobile industry. In such an industry the potential for in-process inventory accumulation is high, since the flow&nbsp;</span></p>

                     <p class="p-3"><span style="font-size: 1rem;">quantities of products and components are both high. The ideal batch size here is one part, known as one-piece flow. Thus, batch size must be kept to a minimum. However, producing too many units may be equally problematic as producing too few in markets which experience sharp fluctuations [1],[4].&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 1rem;">Naturally, for a JIT system to be able to operate, a pull system of production is required. This is due to fact that communication between downstream and upstream processes is vital for the&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 1rem;">correct regulation of material flow. Kanbans were developed for this purpose and are still widely utilised today.</span></p>

            <div class="mbr-text col-12 mbr-fonts-style display-7 col-md-12"><p>To look at the advantages of implementing JIT one has to look at the advantages of not having a large inventory. High inventory requires labour costs where staff needs to control and manage the inventory. Such labour costs aren’t enhancing the value of the product and are therefore a non-value-adding activity. Hence, they are an added expense which are lowering the profit margin for the company and which are being drastically decreased through the use of JIT manufacturing. Another advantage is that one has more space since less inventory is being stored. Having a small inventory leads to more accuracy when it comes to calculations with regard inventory storage. (Less items to store results in less mistakes such as counting errors, transaction errors, etc.) With high inventories, quality problems in components being stored can go undetected, thus when having a smaller storage such damaged goods can be noticed easier. This is clearly demonstrated in Figure 1. Implementing JIT has come at a slow pace because some manufacturers were reluctant to change to an approach where the inventory lacks extra units [5].</p></div>
